# Wordle_XXL
Classic Wordle but you can play bunch of it at the same time.

### What is the difference?
This version of wordle allows you to play more than one wordle at the same time.
Your attempt count is wordle count plus five.

---

### Usage
First, you should enter a positive number which is your wordle amount. 

Then, give a guess. Code will check this guess for every word and gives the output.

Analyze the outputs and continue. Find the best guess for every word.
